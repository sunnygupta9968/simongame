        <h3>The principle of the game is simple</h3>
        <p>The player have to memorize the series of illuminated colors and reproduce itim the same sequences. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors / sounds randomly generated by the Simon.In each round a new key is added to the series and the game become increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
           <li>At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.</li>
           <li>The player has to press the same key.</li>
           <li>Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.</li>
           <li>The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.</li>
           <li>And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.</li>
           <li>If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!</li>
